# main.exe 
this program run a simulation of rumors spreading in a population that generates from one source randomlly.
in the beginning the user can run the simmulation in diffault parameters or change them as he wishes , the parameters are:
* P = 0.75 (population density in 100*100 grid)
* L = 2 (the number of generation to wait between spreading one rumor after another)
* Si = 0.25 (i={1,2,3,4},si represent the precentage of people in the population of each level of scepticism and their tendency to belive and spread a rumor they hear, the people are located randomally in the grid)

at the end of the program summery will be desplayed of the number and precentage of rumormongers after 55 generation.

# q2.exe
in this program we wanted to implement a seperate strategy that would help change the rate of rumor spreading.
the idea of the strategy is to locate people with low level of scepticism from sitting next to each other.
